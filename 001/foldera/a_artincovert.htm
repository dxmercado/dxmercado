Born in San Pablo City, Laguna, Doel Salvador Recepcion Mercado made the eldest of four children of Elvira Recepcion and Domingo Mercado. He finished elementary school and graduated with honors at the University of Saint Anthony. Subsequently, as part of the providential passers, he continued his studies and acquired his secondary diploma at the Philippine Science High School – Bicol Region Campus. Doel, still massed with the crème of the crop, then entered the University of the Philippines – Los Baños (UPLB) Campus and took Civil Engineering courses. It was during his college years that he started finding himself being really drawn to visual arts and decided to focus his interests in such field.  Doel joined the only art organization in UPLB, the UP Painters’ Club. Being immersed into such colorful industry, he started participating to different competitions and began showcasing his masterpieces at different exhibitions. Doel involved himself into Cryptographism, a visual arts style that highly incorporates mathematical codes and ciphers. He calls his pieces Coded Art and signs them DSRMercado. In 2011, together with a colleague, he pillared the creation of MakiSining, a social art group of fine artists practicing in Laguna. In 2012, Doel Mercado served as Makisining’s President.

It was during grade school when Doel learned how to play musical instruments (banduria, octavina and laud). While learning, he experienced an unusual observation. Amazingly, he started seeing glimpses of different colors at the back of his eyes every time he heard distinctive sounds. He saw astonishing colors, different hues and different shades, as he listened to different sounds. Colors of dark brown shades would spontaneously appear behind his eyes upon hearing the lowest notes whenever he tried to tune a banduria. These brown shades would, in turn, gradually change to silver while he tried reaching and tuning to the highest notes. Though the observation did not occur with all kinds of sounds he heard, he noted that every time he heard a tricycle coming, he would see colorful flashes of gray and blue, but would notice a different shade of green when his school service was approaching near. This gave Doel the capability of distinguishing things just by simply listening to their sounds, without the need to look at them. This amazing color-sound relationship condition, Doel just discovered after some time thru reading a novel by Dean Koontz entitled Sole Survivor, is called Synesthesia, a psychological condition where a person experiences a mix on two different sensory skills.

Being a color-sound synesthete and having the ability to see colors while hearing sound, Doel integrated Synesthesia into visual arts, with an exciting twist.
He began creating works of art with a tonic musical approach, using musical notes as his primary cipher for Cryptographism. With an extra twist of mathematics in his art pieces, his work displays a stylish world of playful musical codes, colorful brush strokes, and ciphers in a stirring mathematical methodology.

One of the most popular of Doel Mercado’s Coded Art is the Synesthesia One (acrylic on canvas, 48” x 36”, 2009). This is the painting which awarded Doel Mercado the Juror’s Choice at the GSIS Art Competition in 2009. Doel Mercado integrated music with visual arts by submerging the Canon D musical composition by Johann Pachelbel into a painting, hiding the musical elements thru mathematical codes. Still possessing the great interests in Cryptographism, he coded the duration of each note with the space between the brush strokes, and ciphered the music‘s octave with the different shades of his brush colors. Hidden behind the bars of colors and hues is the song’s complete set of musical notes, all packaged in an exciting maze of music and visual arts. In the end, Doel Mercado has created a powerful combination of stylistic art, with a wonderfully concealed music, ciphered by clever mathematics.
